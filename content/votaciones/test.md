description: Hinata did it. He got reincarnated into another world, took up the
  mantle of Hero, and slew the dreaded Demon Lord alongside his party of fellow
  adventurers. As his reward, he’s returned to Earth to resume a normal life. Or
  it would be if it wasn’t for the fact that his dark elf companion Mariabelle
  decided to travel to Earth to come and live with him! Now she uses her arcane
  talents to ward off any potential romantic rivals and capture Hinata’s
  affection.
